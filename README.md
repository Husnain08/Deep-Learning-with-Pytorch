# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repository contains a series of Deep Learning projects ranging from Computer Vision , Generative Adversarial Networks, NLP and Deployment using Amazon Web Serives (AWS) , which were part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity. As you will notice, the project starts with a template code and the code is build up sequentially in subsequent steps as we go on through the project.
## Getting Started

To get started, download this repository as a zip file or fork it.
### Prerequisites

To get started, you need to install the following

```
* PyTorch
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
Furthermore, there are links for downloading data that are embedded inside the notebook for ease of use 
```

### Installing

To install PyTorch, go to [PyTorch] (https://pytorch.org/)
```
* Choose your Operating System and whether you want to have CUDA installed on your system
* For example, you could install the stable version of PyTorch on Windows using pip as
* pip3 install torch==1.3.0+cpu torchvision==0.4.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

#### Projects Detail
There are total 5 projects included in this repository. They are

* Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns
* Dog Breed Classifier
* Generating Artistic Faces with DCGAN
* TV Script Generation using LSTM
* Deploying a Sentiment analysis model with AWS
* Facial Key-points recognition system using CNNs in PyTorch

## Built With

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - The web framework used

## Contributing
